Currently, the intuitive greedy algorithm is generally used for appointment scheduling in health facilities, such as dental clinic. We look into another approach, which is based on statistical data, develop the algorithm, that optimizes the scheduling process, benefiting both the facility and its customers, and then test it on the historical data, using simulation (in progress); positive results of the simulation will indicate that the algorithm is more efficient than the original greedy algorithm, which potentially allows us to implement it in the form of a scheduling software for the variety of health facilities in Canada.
