In this paper we consider the specific diet problem, which comes from the real life situation: an average student chooses a two weeks diverselunch plan based on food available on campus. A mixed integer programming model is used to find an optimal lunch plan, so that Daily Recommended Intake is satised and consumption of harmful nutrients is minimized. The results obtained for a specic case of SFU Surrey Campus were found to be very reasonable.
